## MovieTracker
## Project Status
Movie Trackerâ€™s main functionality has been completed. In the future I intend to clean up the UX/UI and make a more appealing site for the user. There are some bug-fixes that need to be addressed as well.

## Reflection
 Movie Tracker was a week long project during my third module at Turing School of Software and Design. During this project we worked off The Movie DB API with the idea that the user should be able to create a user-name, sign in as a user, and save favorite movies. With the intention of becoming comfortable using Redux the technologies used to create this app were React.js, React-Redux, Redux-thunk, React-Router 4.0, PostgreSQL, Vanilla JS, JSX and CSS.
 
A large challenge in developing Movie Tracker was not only familiarizing myself with Redux, but learning to test an app utilizing React-Redux by becoming familiar with redux-mock-store. In the future I would have fun building more applications utilizing React-Redux to further my skill set in implementing such technology and look forward to teaching myself Flux as well.
